# Overview
webWC.js (or World Creator) generates a huge amount of data about a fantastical world, but it doesn't generates an UI neither a graphical visualization for the data generated. That's why this documentation exists.

Since webWC runs at user's machine and not in a server, it doesn't require an OAuth or GET endpoint, it's not a REST API, it's just a big chunk of data that you can format and get awesome results

<h2>What it can do</h2>
Create a world with nations, realms, military forces (with allies and enemies), unique characters with a background history (folklore for most important characters), religions with unique gods and godesses and bloodlines for each character.

<h2>What it cannot do</h2>.js
Write an entire movie or book for you.

# Installation
It's pretty simple to have webWC.js in your project, you just simply need to choose if you wanna use the file in the cloud or download it.
